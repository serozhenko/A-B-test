# ðŸ“Š A/B Test Analysis

Analyze the results of **A/B testing** using statistical methods in **Python** and create a visualization that shows key conversion metrics.

## ðŸ§ª Step 1. Calculate Statistical Significance
In the A/B testing module, statistical significance was previously analyzed using online calculators, which is not very convenient.  
The first and most important step is to refine the calculation of statistical significance using a **Python script**.

For analysis, we used a dataset and created a notebook in **Google Colab** to calculate the statistical significance for four metrics:

- `add_payment_info / session`  
- `add_shipping_info / session`  
- `begin_checkout / session`  
- `new_accounts / session`  

The significance was calculated:
- in total for the test,  
- by test groups,  
- by countries,  
- by devices, etc.

## ðŸ“Š Step 2. Visualization in Tableau
The results were visualized in **Tableau**, with key conversion metrics uploaded to the dashboard for interactive exploration.
